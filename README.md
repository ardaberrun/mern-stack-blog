```
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xicfl.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT = 5000
SECRET_ADMIN_USERNAME = admin
SECRET_ADMIN_PASSWORD = 12345 
// I will perform the authentication procedures in the future using SECRET_ADMIN_USERNAME and SECRET_ADMIN_PASSWORD .
```
4. Start the server and client.
